There are some scenarios when an external library is required. Pantheon has installed a number of common libraries that are available on the platform.


<!-- h2 id="pdftk"><a href="http://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit">PDFTK - PDF Tool Kit</a></h2>


<p><img alt="" class="basic" src="/source/docs/assets/images/desk_images/110693.png" style="width: 473px; height: 107px;" /></p>


<p>In its own words: &quot;If PDF is electronic paper, then pdftk is an electronic staple-remover, hole-punch, binder, secret-decoder-ring, and X-Ray-glasses. Pdftk is a simple tool for doing everyday things with PDF documents.&quot;</p>


<p>PDFTK can be found on your application server @ /usr/bin/pdftk. The current version supported on Pantheon is 1.44.</p>


<p>To install, add&nbsp;<br />
To install, first put your development site in SFTP mode. Then, execute the following commands from your local terminal:</p>


<pre class="terminal">
drush @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV dl pdftk token libraries
drush @pantheon.SITENAME.ENV en pdftk
</pre // -->
## [WKHTMLtoPDF](http://wkhtmltopdf.org/)

WebKit HTML allows you to create a snapshot or capture the content of a web page easily in a PDF.

WKHTMLtoPDF can be found on your application server at `/srv/bin/wkhtmltopdf`

### Drupal
To install from your local Development environment, you'll need the Print module and to create a symlink to the hosted library into your site's libraries directory:
```bash
drush dl print
mkdir -p sites/all/libraries/wkhtmltopdf
ln -s /srv/bin/wkhtmltopdf sites/all/libraries/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf
git add .
git commit -m "Added WKHTMLtoPDF library"
git push
```

### WordPress
Currently, there are no known plugins that implement WKHTMLtoPDF directly. However, you can use the converter by creating a custom plugin or by placing the code within your theme's `functions.php` file.

## [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

In its own words, "PhantomJS is a headless WebKit with JavaScript API. It has fast and native support for various web standards: DOM handling, CSS selector, JSON, Canvas, and SVG."

PhantomJS is located at `/srv/bin/phantomjs` on your application server.

### Drupal PhantomJS Configuration

Once you have downloaded and enabled the PhantomJS Capture module, the next step will be configuring the image toolkit settings. Navigate to the Image toolkit settings page at: `/admin/config/user-interface/phantomjs_capture` to specify the library path.

**Path to phantomJS:** `/srv/bin/phantomjs`


## [Apache Tika](http://tika.apache.org/)

The Apache Tika™ toolkit detects and extracts metadata and structured text content from various documents using existing parser libraries.  


Tika can extract content from a number of document formats such as HTML, XML, Microsoft Office document formats, and PDFs and more.

### Drupal Tika Configuration

Once you have downloaded and installed the ApacheSolr Attachments module (apachesolr_attachments), the next step will be configuring the module's settings.

Navigate to the Tika settings page at: `/admin/config/search/apachesolr/attachments` and enter the fields as follows:

**Extract Using:** Tika (local java application)  
**Tika Directory Path:** `/srv/bin`  
**Tika jar file:** tika-app-1.1.jar

The last step will be to verify that your site is able to extract text from documents, click **Test your Tika Attachments** under the Actions section.

If everything is working correctly, you should see the success message, _"Text can be successfully extracted"_ as shown below.

### WordPress Tika Configuration
There are no known plugins in the WordPress.org repository that will enable the use of Tika. There is a project on GitHub that claims you can use it; however, we are still testing it to make sure it works.

## [ImageMagick](http://www.imagemagick.org)

ImageMagick is a software suite to create, edit, compose, or convert bitmap images. It can read and write images in a variety of  [formats](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/formats.php) (over 100) including  [DPX](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/motion-picture.php),  [EXR](http://www.imagemagick.org/script/high-dynamic-range.php), GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PDF, PNG, Postscript, SVG, and TIFF. Use ImageMagick to resize, flip, mirror, rotate, distort, shear and transform images, adjust image colors, apply various special effects, or draw text, lines, polygons, ellipses and Bézier curves.   

Pantheon runs the latest stable packaged version in Fedora, which is currently ImageMagick 6.8.6-3 2014-04-08 Q16.

### Drupal ImageMagick Configuration

Once you have downloaded and enabled the Imagemagick module, the next step will be configuring the image toolkit settings. Navigate to the Image toolkit settings page at: `admin/config/media/image-toolkit` to select ImageMagick.


## Troubleshooting and FAQs
#### What if I need a library not listed here?
If you need a library not listed on this page, submit a support ticket including a description of your use case and a link to the library's webpage.

All libraries will evaluated by Pantheon's Operations Team on a case-by-case basis.

#### Will you setup and configure the module/plugin for me?
No. This is not within our [scope](docs/articles/scope-of-support/). It is important to be aware of how a Drupal module or WordPress plugin is setup and how it functions. This will prove invaluable in cases where you need to plan and build your site.

#### How long does the process take?
This depends on the library that you would like to be installed, the impact it could possibly have on a system, roadmap and organizational goals. During the process we will let you know if the request is denied or approved, along with an expected timeline.  

It is very important to note, these requests are not guaranteed and it is possible the feature requests may be denied. As a result we recommend you should set aside enough time for alternative solutions.

#### What version of XYZ library is installed?
As these libraries are installed system-wide, we use the latest packaged version of the libraries available.  New versions may be installed without notice as security updates or other upstream changes are made available.
